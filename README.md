## Overview of Project
This project was initialized to provide V. Isualize and their team (henceforth referenced as 'Pyber') with a full breakdown of the 2019 rideshare data collected on their drivers operating in Rural, Suburban, and Urban service areas. The analysis covers the aggregation, sorting, and presentation of the data provided in single category and combined format; The charts contained herein show, respectively, the percent split of drivers by city type, the percent division of total fares by city type, variability of fares over a determined period of time, and more.

### Purpose
When running a business, it's prudent to know where the money comes from, and where it needs to go. That sounds like a loading screen, but really at the bottom of it all is a need to shore up weak areas and maintain those that are strong. The objective of this report and attached charts is intended to show exactly that: which operating ares bring in the most money, which areas may need to be looked at, and which are actively hindering company growth. While the grand majority of this report is an executive-level overview, also contained within the data is a breakdown of all cities individually, and could be separately analyzed for even more targeted campaigns by locale.

There are a couple areas specifically I would like to draw attention to, chiefly the combined data chart shown below:

and the chart showing all data together:

In both of these we can see the relationships in the service ares, but one is better for a presentation than the other. The combined data chart is very good at showing the direct, raw numbers, but isn't great at showing that value's impact on the entire company. Going off of just the chart, one could infer that rural drivers are paid out very well compared to the other types, and that their data should have a bigger impact. On the other hand, the bubble chart shows us that the urban area has the most drivers and incoming money by far, entirely dwarfing Rural's high per-driver value. 

This is a perfect example of why having more than way to present the data is critical, being able to show the true numbers and then something a little more visually digestible with those numbers in mind makes for a better grasp of the data, and allows for faster and better informed business and strategy decisions on the part of the board.
